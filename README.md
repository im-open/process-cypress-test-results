# process-cypress-test-results

This action works in conjunction with another step that runs `cypress run --reporter mochawesome `.  This action takes the generated results json file and creates a Status Check or PR Comment depending on the flags set with the test outcome.  

This action does not run the Cypress tests itself and it can only process one results file at a time.

## Failures
The status check can be an item on the workflow run, a PR comment or on the PR Status Check section.  If the test results contain failures, the status check will be marked as failed. Having the status check marked as failed will prevent PRs from being merged. If this status check behavior is not desired, the `ignore-test-failures` input can be set and the outcome will be marked as neutral if test failures are detected. The status badge in the comment or status check body will still indicate a failure.

## Limitations
GitHub does have a size limitation of 65535 characters for a Status Check body or a PR Comment.  This action will fail if the test results exceed the GitHub [limit].  To mitigate this size issue only failed tests are included in the output.

If you have multiple workflows triggered by the same `pull_request` or `push` event, GitHub creates one checksuite for that commit.  The checksuite gets assigned to one of the workflows randomly and all status checks for that commit are reported to that checksuite. That means if there are multiple workflows with the same trigger, your status checks may show on a different workflow run than the run that created them.

## Action Outputs

## Usage Examples
### npm setup
1. These examples require a few npm packages to be installed, generally as dev dependencies:
   - mochawesome
   - mochawesome-merge
   - mochawesome-report-generator
2. Some npm scripts have also been added to the project   
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "precypressrun": "rm -rf mochawesome-report/", 
      "cypressrun": "cypress run --project ./ --reporter mochawesome --reporter-options overwrite=false,html=false,json=true",
      "cypressreport": "mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report/*.json > raw-results.json && marge --reportDir cypress-results raw-results.json"
    }
    ```
    - `cypressrun`:
      - `overwrite=false`: This flag is set to false so a separate json file is created per test/suite.  If not set, each test overwrites the previous test results so a comprehensive report cannot be generated.    
      - `html=false`:  This tells *mochawesome* not to generate an html report since we'll be doing that after the test run.
      - `json=true`: This tells *mochawesome* to generate json result files which we will be merged together in the `cypressreport` script.
    - `precypressrun`:
      -  Since the `overwrite` flag is false, we need a way to remove results between test runs which is what this script does.  By default *mochawesome* puts the results in the `mochawesome-report` directory.
    - `cypressreport`:
      - `mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report/*.json > raw-results.json`: merges all json files into one
      - `marge --reportDir cypress-results raw-results.json`: Generates the html report from the merged json file and puts it in the `cyress-results` directory

A step by step tutorial that sets up *mochawesome* can be found on [Test reporting with Cypress and Mochawesome].

## Contributing

When creating new PRs please ensure:
1. The action has been recompiled.  See the [Recompiling](#recompiling) section below for more details.
2. For major or minor changes, at least one of the commit messages contains the appropriate `+semver:` keywords listed under [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
3. The `README.md` example has been updated with the new version.  See [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
4. The action code does not contain sensitive information.

### Recompiling

If changes are made to the action's code in this repository, or its dependencies, you will need to re-compile the action.

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build

# Bundle the code (if dependencies are already installed)
npm run bundle
```

These commands utilize [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#bundling-for-node) to bundle the action and
its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.

### Incrementing the Version

This action uses [git-version-lite] to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge.  The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.
| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| major          | +semver:breaking                            |
| major          | +semver:major                               |
| minor          | +semver:feature                             |
| minor          | +semver:minor                               |
| patch          | *default increment type, no comment needed* |
